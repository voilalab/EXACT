This code is associated with the following paper, and reproduces the CT phantom simulation results presented there: 

Accurate, Provable, and Fast Nonlinear Tomographic Reconstruction: A Variational Inequality Approach
https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19925

This code runs simulations on a single-material CT phantom to compare different iterative reconstruction algorithms across a range of settings including variation in X-ray source intensity and number of projections.

The main file is `runner.py` which can be edited to control which algorithms are compared and under what settings.
